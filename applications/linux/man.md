# Man Pages

You will find that just about every Linux application comes with a man page (manual) that describes how it is used. If you unsure about how to use a command, it is good practice to first take a look at the man page.

- I found this project that does some work at describing a command and its flag based on the man page.
- You can view man pages from the terminal, but if you would like to browse a collection of commands, this is one of the best out there although it doesn't rank very high on google searches.
