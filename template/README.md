Each top level directory should represent a general topic of interest that relates to its contents. Use this top line if there is one statement that should be the first to be read.

README<span>.</span>md
---
Within each directory there should be a READM<span>.</span>md file that established the purpose of the directory and the type of content the reader is likely to find by browsing further. It is common to link directly to pages of interest from this page and should be treated like a table of contents.

As much information to direct the reader in the right direction when researching a topic should be given without recreating other resources that are not primary references. Use the References section to direct to referenced sources. Primary sources are things like manuals or official documentation. Other references contain user genereated content and differ only by the level of detail that should be recreated. It may be acceptable to only reference a source inline directly with the content they provided and reserved the References section for topic authorities.

Headings
---
Headings are the primary division element used to separate the content on a page. Use either the three dash on a newline (---) or double pound (##) markdown syntax.

### Subtopic
Additional headings can be used as needed and provide for three levels of additional structure. A lot of times the rendering of the first two heading levels look better for only page titles, but make an exception to this if necessary.

## Example
### Level 3
The levels really don't matter. Just use them to establish sections of your content. However, headings should not be used for topics that require a full page entry. If the headings are not directly related to the page topic, create entries in separate files.
#### Level 4

##### Level 5
###### Level 6


References
---
Another common structure to any topic is a list of References so the reader can continue their education by linking to the same sources that created this document.

References can be linked directly inside an article using the markdown syntax.
